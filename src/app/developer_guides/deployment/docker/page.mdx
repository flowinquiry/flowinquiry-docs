# Docker

## Multi-Platform Deployment

Our dedicated [repository](https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry-ops) provides all the resources needed for flexible deployment configurations. With both the frontend and backend packaged as
Docker images, FlowInquiry is ready to run on any platform compatible with containerized solutions, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS, Azure, and more

### Docker Compose

The Docker Compose example demonstrates how to quickly run FlowInquiry in a containerized environment, ideal for testing or local LAN use.
For more details, explore the flowinquiry-docker folder in the [flowinquiry-ops](https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry-ops) repository.

    Customer["Customer"] -- HTTPS --> Caddy["Caddy (Reverse Proxy)"]

    subgraph FlowInquiry
        direction LR
        Caddy -- HTTP --> Frontend["FlowInquiry Frontend"]
        Frontend -- HTTP --> Backend["FlowInquiry Backend"]
    end
```

The FlowInquiry Docker Compose setup uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy to serve HTTPS even for both localhost and LAN environments.
Caddy is configured with a Caddyfile that supports the domains `localhost` and `local.flowinquiry.io`

```
local.flowinquiry.io, localhost {
    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    @http {
        protocol http
    }
    redir @http https://{host}{uri}

    # Enable HTTPS with internal TLS
    tls internal

    # Match and reverse proxy for API routes (except /api/auth)
    @apiNotAuth {
        path /api/*
        not path /api/auth/*
    }
    reverse_proxy @apiNotAuth back-end:8080

    # Reverse proxy all other requests to the front-end
    reverse_proxy /* front-end:3000
}
```

You can change the domain name to any name you prefer.

  If you use your custom domain in your local machine, remember to add it into
  the file `/etc/hosts`
</Callout>

Navigate to the `flowinquiry-docker` folder and run the `all.sh` script located in the `scripts` directory.

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-docker git:(main) ✗ scripts/all.sh

then run the docker compose `docker compose -f services.yml up`

```

Open the browser, and access to the address https//localhost or https://local.flowinquiry.io (or your custom domain). Use the default the either following credentials:

- Administrator:

  - Username: admin@flowinquiry.io
  - Password: admin

#### Local HTTPS

Caddy uses its local CA to issue certificates, which means that HTTP clients outside the container won’t automatically trust the TLS certificate served by Caddy.
To resolve this, you may need to install Caddy's root CA certificate in your host machine’s trust store.

The Caddy root CA certificate can be found at flowinquiry-docker/caddy/certificate-authority/root.crt. This file is only generated when you run the FlowInquiry stack
with Caddy included. For detailed steps, refer to the Caddy documentation: [Local HTTPS with Docker](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running#local-https-with-docker)
