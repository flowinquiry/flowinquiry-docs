# FlowInquiry Docker Images

## Build your own docker images

You can build your own Docker images and deploy them anywhere, or use the pre-built FlowInquiry images available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/flowinquiry)

<Tabs items={['Front-end', 'Back-end']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        To build and publish Docker images for the FlowInquiry front-end, use the Dockerfile in the root folder along with the `scripts/docker_deployment.sh` script.
        Use the argument `--tag $version` if you want to customize the docker image version

        ```bash
        flowinquiry-frontend git:(main) scripts/docker_deployment.sh --tag 0.0.1

        FlowInquiry backend uses Jib to build and deploy Docker images to the Docker repository. To change the Docker image
        version, edit the `projectVersion` attribute in the `gradle.properties` file.

        Open the terminal and navigate to the root folder. Use the command `./gradlew :server:jibDockerBuild -Djib.dockerClient.executable=/path/to/docker` to build the Docker image, or `./gradlew :server:jib  -Djib.dockerClient.executable=/path/to/docker` to build and deploy it.

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) ./gradlew :server:jibDockerBuild -Djib.dockerClient.executable=/usr/local/bin/docker

        > Task :server:jibDockerBuild
