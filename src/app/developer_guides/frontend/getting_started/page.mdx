# Getting Started

FlowInquiry front-end uses [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) framework to develop its UI.

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

Access the latest source code for flowinquiry's front-end at https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry-frontend

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="flowinquiry-frontend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `public` contains static assets, such as files and images, served by Next.js
- `scripts` Includes useful scripts for validating environment settings, setting up project environment variables, and more
- `src` the FlowInquiry's frontend source code

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry frontend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file .env.local. FlowInquiry offers two options for creating this configuration file:

- Using Bash Scripts: Users can run provided Bash scripts, which prompt for inputs, validate the information, and then automatically generate the configuration file.
- Editing a Template Manually: A template configuration file (.env.local.example) is provided, allowing users to manually edit and create their .env.local file. This option is recommended for Windows users who cannot run Bash scripts.

    #### Checking environments

    FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the valid_checks.sh script located in the scripts folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

    ```bash
    ➜  FlowInquiry-frontend git:(main) scripts/valid_checks.sh
    Running node_check.sh...
    Node.js version: 20.14.0
    Node.js version is 20.14.0, which is greater than or equal to 18.
    node_check.sh succeeded.
    Running pnpm_check.sh...
    pnpm is installed.
    pnpm version: 9.7.0
    pnpm_check.sh succeeded.
    Your environments settings satisfy FlowInquiry's conditions
    ```

    #### Setup scripts

    You will need to run the following scripts:

    - `scripts/init_git_hooks.sh`: Sets up a git hook to automatically format and check code logic each time you commit changes.

    - `scripts/init_environments.sh`: Create a new `.env.local` file, which is used by the Next.js application to read predefined environment variables

    <Callout emoji="💡">
        You can run the `scripts/all.sh` script, which will check your environment
        settings and perform the necessary configurations, eliminating the need to run
        multiple scripts individually
    </Callout>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update its content following the inline instructions
        ```bash
        # BACK_END_URL: The base URL of the backend API that the Next.js application communicates with.
        # Typically used for server-side API calls in your application. Example: http://localhost:8080
        BACK_END_URL=

        # NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: A publicly exposed base URL for the backend API.
        # Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser and used for client-side API calls.
        # Example: http://localhost:8080
        NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=

        # AUTH_SECRET: A secret key used by the authentication library (`auth.js`) for securing tokens.
        # This was automatically added by running `npx auth`.
        # For production, it is recommended to use a securely generated key. Learn more: https://cli.authjs.dev
        AUTH_SECRET=
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

#### Run in dev mode

Open the terminal and run the command

```bash
pnpm dev
```

it will launch the process to start the FlowInquiry front-end at the default port `3000`

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-frontend git:(main) pnpm dev

> frontend@0.1.0 dev ~/flowinquiry-frontend
> next dev

  ▲ Next.js xx.x.xx
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local

 ✓ Starting...
 ✓ Ready in 1805ms
```
