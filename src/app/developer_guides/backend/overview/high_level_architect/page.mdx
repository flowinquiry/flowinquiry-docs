# High Level Architect

The FlowInquiry Backend is the core service layer of the FlowInquiry application, responsible for handling business logic, data management, event-driven actions, and integrations. It provides RESTful APIs to interact with the FlowInquiry Frontend and other systems, ensuring secure, scalable, and efficient operations. The backend adheres to a modular design where each component has a distinct responsibility to enhance maintainability and extensibility.

## 1. Rest Controller

Acts as the entry point for all API requests from the FlowInquiry Frontend.
Handles HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and routes them to the appropriate service layer.
Validates incoming data and transforms responses to fit client requirements.

## 2. Service

Contains the business logic for processing and managing application data.
Coordinates between different components like Repository, Mail Component, and Event Listeners.
Ensures data integrity and enforces application rules.

[MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/) is extensively used at the service layer to seamlessly transform entities into data transfer objects (DTOs) and vice versa.

## 3. Repository

Facilitates direct interaction with the database, focusing solely on data access and manipulation.
Performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for backend entities with precision and efficiency.
Optimizes database queries to ensure high performance and reliability.
Does not include or manage any business logic, maintaining a clear separation of concerns in the FlowInquiry architecture.

## 4. Mail Component

Handles email communication with users and stakeholders, ensuring seamless interaction.
Sends notifications, alerts, and confirmations as triggered by the Service layer.
Formats emails and ensures reliable delivery through integration with external mail services.
While optional during the development stage, the Mail Service becomes a mandatory component in the production environment to support critical workflows.

We use [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) as a templating engine to generate HTML email formats for user communication

## 5. Event Listeners

Listens to and processes events published by the Service layer.
Facilitates event-driven architecture by decoupling components.
Executes asynchronous or scheduled tasks in response to events.

We use Spring Events to publish and handle events within the FlowInquiry process. To support a modular architecture and maintain separation of concerns, multiple event listeners can be assigned to a single event. While this design may occasionally result in duplicate database queries, we address this by leveraging caching or by having the Service layer prefetch and distribute common data to the listeners, thereby reducing redundant calls and improving overall efficiency.

## 6. Scheduler Jobs

Executes periodic or scheduled tasks within the backend.
Triggers predefined workflows, SLA checks, or cleanup operations.
Integrates with the Service layer to ensure scheduled tasks align with application logic.
We use [ShedLock](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock) to ensure that identical jobs do not run in parallel, preventing potential conflicts and maintaining job consistency.

## FlowInquiry Modules

FlowInquiry is organized into five core modules, with plans to expand as the application evolves. Each module encapsulates functionality for specific areas of the system:

- **Audit:**
  Handles all code related to auditing, including tracking changes and recording historical data for accountability.

- **Collab:**
  Manages collaboration features such as notifications and comments. Future enhancements will include knowledge management capabilities.

- **Fss (File System Services):**
  Focuses on file and resource management, including cloud file storage and related operations.

- **Team:**
  Covers functionality for teams, organizations, and workflows, as well as core business information.

- **UserManagement:**
  Responsible for user management, access control, and resource permissions to ensure secure and efficient operations.

This modular design ensures scalability, maintainability, and the ability to integrate additional functionality seamlessly as the application grows.

All these modules are organized under the package `io.flowinquiry.modules` and adhere to the following consistent package design principles.

### FlowInquiry package design

To maintain a clean and consistent architecture, FlowInquiry follows these package design principles for organizing modules:

- **Domain (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.domain):**
  Contains application-specific classes, such as Hibernate entities, representing the core business domain.

- **Repository (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.repository):**
  Includes all Spring Data repositories used for database access and operations.

- **Service (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.service):**
  Implements business logic and rules, interacts with the database through repositories, integrates with mail components, and publishes events for further processing by event listeners.

- **DTO (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.service.dto):**
  Contains Data Transfer Objects used for exchanging data between the FlowInquiry backend, frontend, or external systems.

- **Mapper (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.service.mapper):**
  Handles transformations between DTOs and entities, ensuring all transformation logic is executed within the service layer.

- **Web Controller (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.web.rest):**
  Houses Spring controllers that provide HTTP methods to handle requests from the FlowInquiry frontend.

- **Event Listeners (io.flowinquiry.modules.module_name.service.listener):**
  Contains event-driven handlers responsible for post-processing tasks in the service layer, such as creating audit logs after saving entities like teams.
