# Getting started

FlowInquiry back-end is a spring boot application, and it has several components:

- Spring Data
- Spring REST
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- Liquibase

FlowInquiry uses Gradle as its build tool and includes the Gradle wrapper in the distribution, so there's no need to install Gradle separately.

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="flowinquiry-server" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="scripts" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="server" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="commons" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tools" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `scripts` Includes useful scripts for validating environment settings, setting up project environment variables, and more
- `server` the FlowInquiry server sources
- `commons` the common codebase for FlowInquiry backend
- `tools` extra tools for FlowInquiry server such as liquibase database migration scripts and more

### Checking environments

FlowInquiry backend requires Java, Docker is already installed. You can run the `valid_checks.sh` script located in the scripts folder to verify
if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-server scripts/valid_checks.sh
Running java_check.sh...
Java Version Information:
openjdk version "21.0.5" 2024-10-15 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)

Java Vendor: Eclipse Adoptium
Java Runtime Environment: OpenJDK Runtime Environment
Java VM Name: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM
Java Home: /usr
Java version is 21, which is greater than or equal to 21.
java_check.sh succeeded.
Running docker_check.sh...
docker_check.sh succeeded.
Your environments settings satisfy FlowInquiry's conditions
```

### Setup scripts

You will need to run the following scripts:

`scripts/init_git_hooks.sh`: Sets up a git hook to automatically format and check code logic each time you commit changes.

`scripts/create_secrets.sh`: Create secrets stored in the `.env.local` file, which is used by the FlowInquiry server

<Callout emoji="💡">
  You can run the `scripts/all.sh` script, which will check your environment
  settings and perform the necessary configurations, eliminating the need to run
  multiple scripts individually
</Callout>

#### Sending email

To use FlowInquiry's email features, such as sending activation emails to users or reminders about upcoming tasks, you'll need an SMTP account. You can configure this with providers like Gmail, Amazon SES, or any SMTP service. Please note that this email setup is intended for use in a local environment only.

Run the script `scripts/mail_config.sh`, it will ask you the STMP information, and then it writes all to the local file `.env.local`

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) ✗ scripts/mail_config.sh
Enter your SMTP host: smtp.gmail.com
Enter your SMTP port: 587
Enter your username: <username>
Enter your password: <password>
Does SMTP require STARTTLS (y/n)? y
Please enter the email address that will be used as the sender for outgoing emails: noreply@flowinquiry.io
Please enter the base URL that will be used for the email template: http://localhost:3000
Backup of .env.local created as .env.local.backup
Configuration has been saved to .env.local
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To use your Google credentials to send a test email, you cannot use your
  regular email password. Instead, you'll need to generate an App Password. For
  detailed instructions, see the guide at
  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en
</Callout>

<Callout emoji="💡">
  For setting up email in a production environment, please refer to our
  documentation [here](/production) or contact the FlowInquiry team for further
  assistance.

### Run application

#### Run postgres database

FlowInquiry uses PostgreSQL as its database and provides pre-configured PostgreSQL settings. You need to run the database before starting the FlowInquiry server.
Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine, then run the command `docker compose -f docker/services.yml` up to start the database

```bash
➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) docker compose -f docker/services.yml up
[+] Running 1/0
 ✔ Container flowinquiry-postgresql-1  Created                                                                                                                                                                        0.0s

```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Be sure to run the scripts/all.sh or scripts/create_secrets.sh script before
  starting the PostgreSQL database, as they will generate a new PostgreSQL
  password and store it in the .env.local file, which the PostgreSQL container
  relies on.
</Callout>

#### Run flowinquiry server

<Tabs items={['Gradle', 'IntelliJ']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        From the root folder, run the command `./gradlew :server:bootRun`

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry-server git:(main) ./gradlew :server:bootRun
        Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 incompatible Daemon could not be reused, use --status for details

        It may take some time before the server APIs are accessible on the default port `8080`

        You can import the FlowInquiry server into IntelliJ as a Gradle project. Once imported, run the `io.flowinquiry.FlowInquiryApp` class as a standalone Java application

        ![IntelliJ](/images/flowinquiry_intellij.png)

        As similar than gradle command, it will take some time before the server APIs are accessible on the default port `8080`
